# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant. The model is based on the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) and uses a Naive Bayes classifier to make predictions based on various tumor features.
